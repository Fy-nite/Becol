# Style Guide

1. No ai generated code
2. Use descriptive names as much as possible
3. Try to have descriptive commit messages
4. Use 4 spaces instead of tabs
5. Use LF instead of CRLF (git can auto change CRLF to LF if you configure it to)
6. Use some comments. Do not comment every line of code but comment the general gist of your code
